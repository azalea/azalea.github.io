I like this puzzle! You may think it is easy for several times, only to find yourself such an idiot soon.

You can vote on <a href="http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/its-the-friday-puzzle-26/" target="_blank">the original post</a> if you need a hint.

Happy Friday!

By the way, can anyone  tell me how I can activate the ibus input method on Ubuntu 9.10??
