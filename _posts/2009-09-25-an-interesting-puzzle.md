<blockquote>Can you take the clock face below, and cut it into four pieces such that the numerals on each part add up to the same number?

<a rel="attachment wp-att-1114" href="http://azaleasays.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/clock2.jpg2009/09/25/an-interesting-puzzle/clock1/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1114" title="clock1" src="http://azaleasays.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/clock1.jpg" alt="clock1" width="450" height="441" /></a>

So, for example, this solution would not work because the numbers on the four pieces add up to different amountsâ€¦.

I like this puzzle! You may think it is easy for several times, only to find yourself such an idiot soon.

You can vote on <a href="http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/its-the-friday-puzzle-26/" target="_blank">the original post</a> if you need a hint.

Happy Friday!

By the way, can anyone  tell me how I can activate the ibus input method on Ubuntu 9.10??
