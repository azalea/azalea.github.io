<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=k5Z-swkd7OM" target="_blank">THON</a>是Penn State每年一次的Dance Marathon，会连续举行2天，目的是为治疗儿童癌症募集资金。每年美国有12500个儿童患有癌症，其中四分之一将会死亡。

1972年Charles Millard建立了Four Diamonds Fund来救助患癌症的儿童，因为他的儿子因癌症而永远离开了他。THON始于1973年，由Penn State的学生发起，历时36年，去年募集了500万多美元。因为"We are Penn State"，使这些成为了可能。

今年THON从22号下午6点到24号下午4点，历时46小时，有近700名跳舞的志愿者将把Line Dance跳45遍。

今天晚上我和pala到会场一看，参加者非常多，除了会场里的数百名跳舞的人外，观众席也几乎“站”无虚席。每小时全场会一起跳一次Line Dance；间歇时间有各种表演，今天是第一届xxx表演奖颁奖晚会，我想主持人是kidding..不过Penn Stat橄榄球队、女足、女篮、网球队等上演了精彩表演，观众不断鼓掌尖叫，尤其是站在我后面的2个mm。。

pala和我的最爱还是那个将要被跳45遍的Line Dance，献上视频和歌词：

Time to get your dancing on

3,000 strong
BJC, all weekend long

On diamonds we will dance
Cancer does not stand a chance
With the Lion by our side
White House, we show our pride

Ticketmaster such disaster
Could they sell out any faster?
JoePa enters, Hall of Fame
Alamo, 500th hundred game

Women's v-ball serves it up
Men in tights, take the cup
Dancing better, faster, stronger
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Get out on that floor
All in this together
Thon '08
Family forever
Come on lions (aw yeah), move those paws (all right)
Now's our chance (uh-huh) to win this fight

BCS what a mess
#1 couldn't guess
Patriots, what a season
Must be easy, when you're cheatin'

Gladiator's tough and mean
Too much spandex on the screen
Top Model marathon
I hate that show, what time's it on?

Everybody's on strike
Why is everybody on strike

Harry Potter cast a spell
That's what who said?
Steve Carell?
We're McLovin' Superbad
Going green L.A. fad

Planet earth
Amazes all
Grab your iPhone
Make a call

Who spread rumors on the Hills?
i-d-k my bff Jill?
You crank that Larry Moore
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Get out on that floor
All in this together
Thon '08
Family forever
Come on lions (aw yeah), move those paws (all right)
Now's our chance (uh-huh) to win this fight

Dolla' dolla' bills y'all
For the for the kids, y'all
46, on our feet
Hershey's care
Can't be beat

Get low low low low
Yeah, yeah, yeah
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

VT in our heart
Honored to be a part
Blue and red start debate
Who will win the White House race?

CNN, news just in
Britney's in the looney bin
YouTube, post your own
Not now chief I'm in the zone

Anyone can be a star,
When you're rockin' on guitar

F T, FTK

Get out on that floor
All in this together
Thon '08
Family forever
Come on lions (aw yeah), move those paws (all right)
Now's our chance (uh-huh) to win this fight

1,2,3,4 Tell me what you're dancing for
BJC Thon '08
We are Penn State

Courage to win this fight
Strength both day and night
Honesty we will not stray
Wisdom Hope finds a way
