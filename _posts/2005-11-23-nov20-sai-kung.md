not many people ever heard of this place, nor did I before I came to UST.

Sai Kung is a market by the seaside, you may say that, however, the bus stop is named 西贡市中心

today is my 2nd time here. My 1st visit is on the day of Genetics midterm haha.

i go there with two of my former classmates of middle school, they are both exchange stu here.

such a coincidence!

we just walk along the seaside and play with dogs! so many here!

then we walk around the market and eat sea food by the sea. very nice, however we are not at all hungry, cos we had lunch and coffee a little while ago..

then we go back to my room to celebrate my birthday!
