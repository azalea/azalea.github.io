喜欢关于Python那段，看来原作者是python粉丝

C   is a racing car that goes incredibly fast but breaks down every fifty miles.

C++   is a souped-up racing car with dozens of extra features that only breaks down every 250 miles, but when it does, nobody can figure out what went wrong.

Java   is a family station wagon. It's easy to drive, it's not too fast, and you can't hurt yourself.

C#   is a competing model of family station wagons. Once you use this, you're never allowed to use the competitors' products again.

Ocaml   is a very sexy European car. It's not quite as fast as C, but it never breaks down, so you end up going further in less time. However, because it's French, none of the controls are in the usual places.

Lisp   looks like a car, but with enough tweaking it can turn into a pretty effective airplane or submarine.

Prolog   is fully automatic: you tell it what your destination looks like, and it does all the driving for you.

Perl   is supposed to be a pretty cool car, but the driver's manual is incomprehensible. Also, even if you can figure out how to drive a perl car, you won't be able to drive anyone else's.

Python   is a great beginner's car; you can drive it without a license. Unless you want to drive really fast or on really treacherous terrain, you may never need another car.

Fortran   is a pretty primitive car; it'll go very quickly as long as you are only going along roads that are perfectly straight. It is believed that learning to drive a Fortran car makes it impossible to learn to drive any other model.

Cobol   is reputed to be a car, but no self-respecting driver will ever admit having driven one.

Forth   is a car you build yourself from a kit. Your car doesn't have to look or behave like anyone else's car. However, a Forth car will only go backwards.

Assembly is a bare engine; you have to build the car yourself and manually supply it with gas while it's running, but if you're careful it can go like a bat out of hell.
