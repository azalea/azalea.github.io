<strong><span style="font-size:10pt;">Additional       Trip Information:</span></strong>

<strong/><em><span style="font-size:10pt;">Above&amp;Beyond</span></em><span style="font-size:10pt;"> is a Christian organization, based in               Boston              , which specializes in providing long-distance bus trips for international       students. We will be traveling on one of their special "sleeper"       busses. This bus will enable us to sit along the sides and at tables while       traveling during the day. Then, while traveling longer distances at night,       the bus is transformed into upper and lower platforms for sleeping. This       allows everyone to have a regular night's sleep in their sleeping bag       while the two drivers take turns driving us through the night. (Enroute we       will stop periodically during the night for gasoline and to use the       restrooms.) As we travel, the <em>Above&amp;Beyond</em> staff or I will occasionally give short       talks/discussions to enhance the experience, which will help us to get       acquainted with each other and to reflect on our lives and some of these       special places and experiences from a Christian perspective.</span>

Some meals are provided by <em>Above&amp;Beyond; </em>others are usually “fast-food” stops. Also, we will periodically       shop at a grocery store for food to bring along on the bus. There is a       toilet on the bus for emergency use, but we stop every 3 hours or so for       bathroom breaks for everyone. Each day there is planned to be an       opportunity to take a shower, at a YMCA, campground, or college athletic       center. The bus has 3 tables that can be used during the day, and you can       bring along playing cards or favorite games, but don't bring elaborate       games that involve small parts that could easily get lost, or which would       be hard to learn.

What to bring? Bring your toothbrush and personal hygiene items, a towel,       a pillow (if you use one), and a warm jacket for cooler nights in the        Rocky Mountains       . Optional items include a hat, camera, and sunscreen!
